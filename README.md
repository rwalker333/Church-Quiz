Making an interactive quiz

I am learning how to code through Teamtreehouse.com and another student posted a challenge in the forum. The original text is below:

'Hi guys I'm building a site for my church and I would like to add a page where there are a series of quiz questions and visitors can answer them. if they answer correctly they get a friendly message saying "alright high five!" or "Great job!" if they get it wrong they get a message saying "ok, try again" or something like that. I want to add at least 50 - 100 questions geared for all levels, for children, teens and adults. Was wondering if you guys can help me.....thanx in advance for all your help!'
